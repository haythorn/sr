Description: Finds causal connections in precision data, finds lags and embeddings in 
  time series, guides training of neural networks and other smooth models, evaluates 
  their performance, gives a mathematically grounded answer to the over-training 
  problem.  Smooth regression is based on the Gamma test, which measures smoothness
  in a multivariate relationship.  Causal relations are smooth, noise is not.  
  'sr' includes the Gamma test and search techniques that use it.
