Description: Finds causal connections in precision data, finds lags and embeddings in 
  time series, guides and evaluates the performance of neural networks and other
  smooth models, gives a mathematically sound answer to the over-training 
  problem.  Smooth regression is based on the Gamma test, which measures smoothness
  in a multivariate relationship.  'sr' includes the Gamma test and search techniques
  that use it. See references in the help for function `gamma_test`.
