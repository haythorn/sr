Title: Smooth Regression - the Gamma test and tools 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wayne Haythorn, Sam Kemp, Antonia Jones
Maintainer: Wayne Haythorn <wayne@haythorn.us>
Description: Smooth regression provides tools for finding causal relations in 
  precision data.  It is based on the Gamma test, which measures the noise in a
  data relationship relative to all smooth models, thus all neural network models
  or differential equations with bounded (finite) derivatives.  Gamma estimates 
  the mean squared error of the best smooth model that can be built on the data 
  it is given. Gamma and search tools are used to identify causal relations, find 
  lags and embeddings in time series analysis, decide how much data is needed 
  to build a stable model, evaluate the performance of a model, and prevent 
  overtraining.
