Title: Smooth Regression - the Gamma Test and Tools 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wayne Haythorn, based on work by Sam Kemp and Antonia Jones
Maintainer: Wayne Haythorn <support@smoothregression.com>
Description: Tools for finding causal relations in precision data.  Smooth 
  regression is based on the Gamma test, which measures the noise in a
  data relationship relative to all smooth models, thus all neural network models
  and differential equations with bounded (finite) derivatives.  Gamma estimates 
  the mean squared error of the best smooth model that can be built on the data 
  it is given. Gamma and search tools are used to identify causal relations, find 
  lags and embeddings in time series analysis, decide how much data is needed 
  to build a stable model, evaluate the performance of a model, and prevent 
  overtraining.
