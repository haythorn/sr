\title{Plot Histogram of Gammas}
\usage{
gamma_histogram(fe_results, bins = 100, caption = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{fe_results}{The result of fe_search or full_embedding_search.  A matrix
containing a column labeled Gamma, of Numeric Gamma values.
It also contains an integer column of masks, but that is not used by this function.}

\item{bins}{Numeric, number of bins in the histogram}

\item{caption}{Character string caption for the plot}
}
\value{
a ggplot object, a histogram showing the distribution of Gamma values
full embedding search output
}
\description{
Produce a histogram showing the distribution in a population of gamma
values, used to examine the result of a full embedding search.  Pass the result
of fe_search() Use this function to look for structure
in the predictors.  For example, it this histogram is bimodal, there is probably
one input variable which is absolutely required for a good predictive function.

\examples{
e6 <- embed(mgls, 7)
t <- e6[ ,1]
p <- e6[ ,2:7]
full_search <- fe_search(predictors = p, target = t)
gamma_histogram(full_search, caption = "my data")
}
